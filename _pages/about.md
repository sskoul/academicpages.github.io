I am a Post-Doctoral researcher at Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne hosted by Volkan Cevher. Prior to that I was very lucky to be a post-doc at Singapore University of Technology and Design hosted by Georgios Piliouras and a PhD student at National Technical University of Athens under the supervision of Dimitris Fotakis. My research interests lie at the intersection of Algorithmic Game Theory, Optimization and Machine Learning. Here you can find my Google Scholar/ DBLP profiles and my CV.
