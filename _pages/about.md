I am a Post-Doctoral researcher at Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne hosted by Volkan Cevher. Prior to that I was very lucky to be a post-doc at Singapore University of Technology and Design hosted by Georgios Piliouras and a PhD student at National Technical University of Athens under the supervision of Dimitris Fotakis. My research interests lie at the intersection of Algorithmic Game Theory, Optimization and Machine Learning. Here you can find my Google Scholar/ DBLP profiles and my CV.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of game theory, theoretical computer science and machine learning. A big part of my research concerns the study of natural game-dynamics through the lens of convex optimization as well as the study of equilibrium-computation problems. Another part of my work concerns the design of online decision making algorithms by coupling optimization techniques with ideas of theoretical computer science. Furthermore, I am also interested in developing efficient methods (or providing lower bounds) for intriguing optimization settings arising in the context of machine learning.
